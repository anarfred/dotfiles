2016-11-14 23:53:21	bgdnvst	RandomLANguy: Fine, first time here! And ya?
2016-11-14 23:53:58	RandomLANguy	That's good :) I'm doing pretty well ^_^
2016-11-14 23:54:45	bgdnvst	Great ^^ Where are you from? :)
2016-11-14 23:54:57	RandomLANguy	Washington state
2016-11-14 23:55:04	RandomLANguy	You?
2016-11-14 23:55:28	bgdnvst	I'm from Quebec, Canada
2016-11-14 23:55:37	RandomLANguy	Oh, nice :)
2016-11-14 23:56:08	RandomLANguy	Birdie: Aren't you around that area of Canada?
2016-11-14 23:57:32	bgdnvst	I didn't thought that there would be other canadian here with so few members
2016-11-14 23:57:38	Birdie	yeah.
2016-11-14 23:58:06	RandomLANguy	Hehe, RtF is Canadian too, but in BC
2016-11-14 23:58:21	bgdnvst	Ok, cool!
2016-11-14 23:58:34	bgdnvst	Birdie: Eastern Canada or are you from Quebec too?
2016-11-14 23:58:48	Birdie	neighbour to quebec.
2016-11-14 23:58:54	RtF	Ontario?
2016-11-14 23:59:08	RtF	Yeah I'm in Prince George bgdnvst, just moved here though from Calgary
2016-11-15 00:00:01	bgdnvst	Nice, never been there yet, I should try to see the west some day
2016-11-15 00:00:36	RandomLANguy	I just got my enhanced license, so eventually I'll have to pay RtF a visit ^_^
2016-11-15 00:00:39	Birdie	I thinking of moving to either Vancouver or Montreal eventually myself.
2016-11-15 00:01:03	RtF	Kind of opposite sides there Birdie
2016-11-15 00:01:04	RtF	lol
2016-11-15 00:01:15	RtF	Well it's extremely scenic bgdnvst
2016-11-15 00:01:47	RtF	And there's a lot of outdoors stuff to do
2016-11-15 00:02:24	bgdnvst	RtF: Yeah, I guess so! I'm more of a cyclist, I guess that would be great to bike in the rockies, if it's possible
2016-11-15 00:02:56	RtF	Oh it definitely is
2016-11-15 00:03:03	bgdnvst	Birdie: nice. I'm living in Montreal since last spring, and it's great. Cheap and there's quite a lot to do
2016-11-15 00:03:11	RtF	Mountain biking is a little safer though, people drive like dumbasses in the west
2016-11-15 00:03:58	bgdnvst	RandomLANguy: Have you ever went in Canada?
2016-11-15 00:04:10	RandomLANguy	Never left the US yet :/
2016-11-15 00:04:23	RandomLANguy	Only ever left the state a handfull of times.
2016-11-15 00:04:48	bgdnvst	RtF: Well, Quebec's drivers are not that great either, even in a cyclist-friendly city like Montreal
2016-11-15 00:05:25	RandomLANguy	Been close enough to see Canada in the distance though :) (San Juan Islands)
2016-11-15 00:05:26	RtF	Well I haven't been to Quebec since I was a kid
2016-11-15 00:05:29	 *	Birdie wonders who she has to blow to get some cheesecake
2016-11-15 00:05:31	bgdnvst	RandomLANguy: oh, alright ^^ well, you shall be able to do so with your licenses ;)
2016-11-15 00:05:44	RtF	But people here tend to take blind corners at 160
2016-11-15 00:05:50	RtF	Stuff like that
2016-11-15 00:06:15	RtF	lol Birdie
2016-11-15 00:06:31	RandomLANguy	lol
2016-11-15 00:06:51	RtF	Also it's pretty funny in PG it has to be the pickup capital of the world, at least 2 in 3 vehicles are big trucks
2016-11-15 00:07:22	RtF	Though they're a bit more tame than truck drivers in Calgary, Calgary has the worst driving I've ever seen and that includes going to LA several times haha
2016-11-15 00:07:46	bgdnvst	Oh jeez, I see >>
2016-11-15 00:08:24	RandomLANguy	wow
2016-11-15 00:08:50	bgdnvst	I'll go to bed now, it's pass midnight here. Glad to have found a abdl channel out there ;) Have a great night/evening!
2016-11-15 00:08:58	RandomLANguy	My brother says drivers in Boston are pretty insane
2016-11-15 00:09:02	RtF	But yeah as far as sports I do backcountry splitboarding, ice climbing, and rock climbing mostly
2016-11-15 00:09:05	RtF	Also some mountain biking
2016-11-15 00:09:07	RtF	Gnight!
2016-11-15 00:09:13	RandomLANguy	Okies, nini bgdnvst :)
2016-11-15 00:09:15	RandomLANguy	sleep well
2016-11-15 00:09:24	bgdnvst	Thanks! ^_^
2016-11-15 00:09:34		[bgdnvst away: sleeping]
2016-11-15 00:13:01	Birdie	strawberry preferrably but any nice one will do.
2016-11-15 00:15:31	RtF	I haven't had cheesecake in at least a year
2016-11-15 00:22:54	RtF	Also I've never liked exhaling that way
2016-11-15 00:23:07	RtF	Though I also never liked smoking lol
2016-11-15 00:23:21	Birdie	I used to be a light smoker for a few years.
2016-11-15 00:23:24	Birdie	:(
2016-11-15 00:23:28	Birdie	But I quit years back.
2016-11-15 00:23:37	RandomLANguy	lol
2016-11-15 00:23:40	Birdie	Recently been craving again though annoyingly.
2016-11-15 00:23:46	RandomLANguy	Wrong channel, RtF :P
2016-11-15 00:24:14	RandomLANguy	Sorry, Birdie :/
2016-11-15 00:24:25	RtF	Oops haha
2016-11-15 00:24:36	RtF	Sorry about that Birdie
2016-11-15 00:24:42	RtF	Just remember that you've come this far
2016-11-15 00:24:49	RtF	And it isn't worth it just for that short moment
2016-11-15 00:24:58	RtF	The hardest part is behind you
2016-11-15 00:25:50	 *	Birdie nods
2016-11-15 00:25:56	Birdie	Sad how it never fully goes away.
2016-11-15 00:26:17	RtF	Yeah, but it's just a challenge like any other
2016-11-15 00:27:03	Birdie	Indeed true.
2016-11-15 00:27:41	RtF	brb
2016-11-15 00:27:46	RandomLANguy	okies
